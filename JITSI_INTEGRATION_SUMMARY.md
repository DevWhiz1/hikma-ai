# Jitsi Meet Integration - Complete Summary

## ✅ Integration Complete!

Your custom Jitsi Meet instance at **hikmameet.live** has been successfully integrated into the Hikma AI platform.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. **Meeting Controller** (`backend/controllers/meetingController.js`)
- Updated `generateJitsiLink()` function to use `hikmameet.live` instead of `meet.jit.si`
- Added support for `JITSI_DOMAIN` environment variable
- All new meeting links will now use: `https://hikmameet.live/HikmaAI-[room-id]`

#### 2. **Message Filter Middleware** (`backend/middleware/messageFilter.js`)
- Added `hikmameet.live` to the whitelist of allowed meeting domains
- Your custom domain links will NOT be blocked by the security filter
- Other external meeting platforms (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, etc.) remain blocked

### Frontend Changes

#### 3. **Meeting Chat Component** (`client/src/components/user/Chat/MeetingChat.tsx`)
- Added `hikmameet.live` to recognized meeting link patterns
- The UI will properly display and handle links from your domain

#### 4. **ChatBot Component** (`client/src/components/user/Chat/ChatBot.tsx`)
- Added `hikmameet.live` to recognized meeting link patterns
- The chatbot will recognize and process your meeting links correctly

## 🚀 How It Works

### Meeting Creation Flow

1. **Scholar schedules a meeting** → System calls `generateJitsiLink()`
2. **Unique room ID is generated** → e.g., `a1b2c3d4e5f6`
3. **Meeting link is created** → `https://hikmameet.live/HikmaAI-a1b2c3d4e5f6`
4. **Link is sent to both participants** via chat/notification
5. **Participants click the link** → Redirected to your Jitsi Meet instance
6. **Video meeting starts** on your Oracle-hosted server

### Security Flow

- ✅ Links from `hikmameet.live` are **ALLOWED** (whitelisted)
- ❌ Links from Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, etc. are **BLOCKED**
- ✅ System-generated meeting links work seamlessly
- ❌ Manual external meeting links are filtered out

## 📝 Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)

Add to your `backend/.env` file if you want to change the domain:

```env
JITSI_DOMAIN=hikmameet.live
```

If not set, it defaults to `hikmameet.live` automatically.

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Schedule a meeting between a scholar and student
- [ ] Verify the generated link uses `hikmameet.live`
- [ ] Click the meeting link and ensure it opens your Jitsi instance
- [ ] Verify both parties can join the meeting
- [ ] Test that external meeting links (Zoom, etc.) are still blocked
- [ ] Confirm your custom links are NOT filtered in chat messages

## 📊 Example Meeting Links

**Before:**
```
https://meet.jit.si/HikmaAI-a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

**After (Now):**
```
https://hikmameet.live/HikmaAI-a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Whitelist-based filtering** - Only your domain is allowed
2. **Unique room IDs** - Each meeting gets a cryptographically random ID
3. **Room prefix** - `HikmaAI-` prefix prevents naming conflicts
4. **External platform blocking** - All other meeting platforms remain blocked

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Meeting links not working?
1. Verify your Jitsi server is running: `https://hikmameet.live`
2. Check SSL certificate is valid
3. Ensure firewall allows:
   - Port 443 (HTTPS)
   - Port 10000 (UDP - video/audio)
   - Port 4443 (TCP - fallback)

### Links being blocked?
1. Check the domain spelling in the filter matches exactly: `hikmameet.live`
2. Restart the backend server after changes
3. Clear browser cache

### Video/audio not working?
1. This is a Jitsi server configuration issue, not the integration
2. Check your Oracle instance firewall rules
3. Verify Jitsi Meet is properly configured for WebRTC

## 📚 Additional Documentation

See `backend/JITSI_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions and advanced configuration options.

## ✨ Next Steps

1. Restart your backend server to apply changes
2. Test the meeting flow end-to-end
3. Monitor the first few meetings to ensure everything works smoothly
4. Configure your Jitsi server settings (branding, features, etc.) on the Oracle instance
