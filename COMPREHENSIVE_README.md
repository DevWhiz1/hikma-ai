## Security

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds
- **Role-based Access**: Middleware checks user roles
- **Route Protection**: Protected routes require authentication
- **Token Expiration**: Tokens expire after set time

### Data Security
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated on server
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Mongoose parameterized queries
- **XSS Protection**: Sanitized user inputs
- **CORS Configuration**: Restricted origins
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data in .env files

### Payment Security
- **Server-side Processing**: Payment intents created on server
- **Webhook Verification**: Stripe webhook signature verification
- **No Card Storage**: Cards never stored, handled by Stripe
- **HTTPS Required**: Secure connections for payments
